    <h1>Male Fantasy</h1>
   <h2>[Verse 1]</h2> 
   <p>Home alone, tryin' not to eat
    Distract myself with pornography
    I <span class="highlight">hate</span> the way she looks at me
    I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
    That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
    I'm going back to therapy</p>
    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p>'Cause I <span class="highlight">loved</span> you then and I <span class="highlight">love</span> you now
    And I don't know how
    Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
    If I'm getting over you
    Or just pretending to
    Be alright, convince myself I <span class="highlight">hate</span> you</p>
    <h2>[Verse]</h2>
    <p>I got a call from a girl I used to know
    We were inseparable years ago
    Thought we'd get along but it wasn't so
    And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
    I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
    But nothing lasts, I know the deal</p>
    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p>But I <span class="highlight">loved</span> you then and I <span class="highlight">love</span> you now
    And I don't know how
    Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
    If I'm getting over you
    Or just pretending to
    Be alright, convince myself I <span class="highlight">hate</span> you
    Can't get over you
    No matter what I do
    I know I should but I could never <span class="highlight">hate</span> you</p>
